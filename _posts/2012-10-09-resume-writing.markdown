A collection of tips on writing kick-ass (supposedly) resume from [Rockport
Institute][rockport].

## Goal ##

A kick-ass resume begins with the focus on the employer's need.  It is the 
beginning of a negotiation of two parties whose goal is to collaborate with 
most ideal partner.  Both sides need not only to understand their own
abilities, but also need to understand the needs of the other party.
Therefore, with a list of qualities and accomplishments on your side, you
need put them into context of your employer's needs. Ask yourself: 

> What would make someone the perfect candidate?

To answer that question, you need to research the goals of your potential
employer. Then, take the list of qualities, abilities, and accomplishments and
see if they ammount to an adequate answer to that question.

> The whole idea is to loosen up your thinking enough so that you will be able
> to see some new connections between what you have done and what the employer
> is looking for.

## Resume Breakdown ##

A kick-ass resume has two sections.  The first section "make assertions about
your abilities, qualities and achievements."  The second section provides the
evidence to cooborate your assertions.

### First Section (Assertion) ###

> The juice is in the assertions section. When a prospective employer finishes
> reading your resume, you want them to immediately reach for the phone to
> invite you in to interviews.

#### The Objective ####

The assertion section begins with the *the objective*, where you want to be
"absolutely clear about your career direction". You want to identify the
qualities that are most important to the employer and that those qualities are
the ones you embody.  Pick two or three qualities, abilities, or achievements
that would standout to the employer.

Bolierplate objective statement:

> An {name of position} positio in an organization where {compelling
> quality 1} and {compelling quality 2} would be needed.

Be adaptive! Research your target employers and tailor the objective to each
employer. Either focus on your career direction (limited work history) or you qualities and
achievements (changing position within the same field).

#### The Summary ####

Following the objective is *the summary*, where you highlight your qualities
that matches your objective (and thus, your potential employer's need).  This
is the most important part of your resume, and "may be the only section fully
read by the employer". 

> Gear every word in the Summary to your targeted goal (the qualities that
> your employer values).

The commoon ingredients of a summary:

> * A short phrase describing your profession
> * Followed by a statement of broad or specialized expertise 
> * Followed by two or three additional statements related to any of the
>   following:
>   * breadth or depth of skills
>   * unique mix of skills
>   * range of environments in which you have experience
>   * a special or well-documented accomplishment
>   * a history of awards, promotions, or superior performance commendations
> * One or more professional or appropriate personal characteristics
> * A sentence describing professional objective or interest

#### Skills and Accomplishments ####

The final part of the assertion section is *the skills and accomplishments*,
where you detail facts that backup your claim to the qualities and
accomplishments stated in *the summary section*.

> Tell the rest of the best of your story.

Keep in mind that a kick-ass resume is an advertisement saying "if you buy
this product, you will get these direct benefits".

### Resume Formats ###

The three types of resume formats are:

Chronological
: A more traditional resume structure that focuses on *the experience* portion
of the resume.  Not recommended by Rockport Institute as the resume format.

Functional
: A format highlighting the major skills and accomplishments.  "It targets the
resume into a new direction or field, by lifting up from all past jobs the key
skills and qualifications to help prove you will be successful in this new
direction or field". Highly recommended by Rockport Institute.

Combined
: Obviously a combination of chronological and functional formats.

### The Evidence Section ###

Even the boring section of the resume should target your potential employer's
needs.  Use every word to advertise yourself.

Portions of the evidence section:

Experience
: List the most recent ones.  Choose the more impressive between the job title
or name of firms. Describe the firms if it impresses potential employer. It is **okay** to list non-paid work.

Education
: "List education in reverse chronological order, degress or licenses first,
followed by certificates and advanced training". List selected courses if it
helps convince the reader of qualitification.

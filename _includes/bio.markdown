#### Biography ####

Hello! My name is Xing Zhou (dekom).  I am currently an undergraduate student
at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] working towards a B.S. in Computer
Science and a minor in Machine Learning.  

I enjoy learning anything and everything related to the field of computer science, from the theoretical to
the hardcore practical implementations.  Aside from twisting my mind into
a pretzel and pulling out my hair, I also enjoy [biking][bike] and
[yoga][ddp].
